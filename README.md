# LiveDemoController

Demo for a trade show designed for both technical and non-technical users. I scaled an existing demo to showcase additional use cases and features, tackling the challenge of restructuring event triggers. The original demo relied on hardware for in-person presentations. I digitized these events by developing a Python-based remote that triggered events via REST APIs. Additionally, I redesigned part of the UI using Vue.js to be co-branded with our event partner. I also authored and created a demo script and a training video to help presenters effectively demonstrate the new features. This required collaboration with one of our founders to implement and document the extensive UI changes for future use. This project enhanced my skills in Python, REST APIs, Vue.js, and UI design, and demonstrated my ability to handle complex, cross-functional projects while providing comprehensive support for end-users.
